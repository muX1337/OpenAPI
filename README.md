# xREL OpenAPI Specifications

This repository contains an unofficial OpenAPI Specification for xREL.

You can edit the Specification online [here](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeMatau/xREL-OpenAPI/master/xRELOpenAPI.yaml) and export the json and yaml file to create a pull request

I have included both the yaml and json file, although only one is needed.
